Two Windows users on your laptop (or two clean VMs)

Use Chrome (already installed)

Run your prepared extractor/importer code

Test banners, language setting, and login â†’ then transfer cookies â†’ see what happens

Step-by-step plan for today
ðŸ”¹ 1. Prepare environment variables

Both extractor and importer scripts require this:

set COOKIE_LAB_TESTMODE=1


Run it in every Command Prompt session before executing your scripts.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Extraction (UserA / VM-A)

Open Command Prompt, go to your project folder:

cd C:\Users\<UserA>\HirokiKurano_cookie_project
set COOKIE_LAB_TESTMODE=1

python extractor\cookie_extractor.py https://www.bbc.com ProfileA ^
  --browser chrome --mode cdp --wait 90 --detach


Replace https://www.bbc.com with your test site.

ProfileA is just a name for this Chrome profile (clean if first time).

During the 90 seconds waiting period:

Accept the data protection / cookie banner

Change language if available

Log in to your account (if you want to test session transfer)

Result â†’ file like:
output\cookies_www.bbc.com.json

ðŸ”¹ 3. Copy cookies to UserB / VM-B

Either via shared folder, USB, or simply commit & pull via Git

Place the file into the same project folder under output\

ðŸ”¹ 4. Import (UserB / VM-B)
cd C:\Users\<UserB>\HirokiKurano_cookie_project
set COOKIE_LAB_TESTMODE=1

python importer\cookie_importer.py https://www.bbc.com ProfileB ^
  --browser chrome --mode cdp --wait 3 --screenshot


ProfileB is a new profile for UserB / VM-B

Script will clear cookies/storage, apply extracted cookies, reload the page

A screenshot is saved:
output\screenshot_after_www.bbc.com.png

ðŸ”¹ 5. Observe results

Banner: Is it already dismissed?

Language: Did the site open in the custom language?

Login: Are you logged in without typing credentials?
